Why yet another smart calculator?

_As of 2021/05, in order from most to least recommended. The list of missing features and bugs is not exhaustive._

- Soulver: Native only. Free only 30 days. Not open-source. By far the best of the alternatives. Differs in some design decisions. It leans more towards free text-like input, while Recomputer is more strict (and less error prone).
- Numi: Doesn't support all rates, in general the grammar doesn't handle a lot of expressions. Multi-word names are not sometimes recognized.
- [Math Notepad](https://mathnotepad.com/): A Jupyter-like interface, enter needs to be hit to see results. No currency support.
- Parsify: Free version limited to 5 lines. Some bugs in grammar. Doesn't support all rates or arbitrary physics expressions.
- NoteCalc: Custom text editor that doesn't support basic native keyboard commands (like go to word boundary). No currency support.
- Numbr: Doesn't support all rates. Not open-source. Broken exponentiation.
- Caligator: Download didn't work on Mac.
